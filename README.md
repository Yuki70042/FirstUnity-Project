## Depot representing my first 2d video game project using Unity!

  - Using this great [tutorial](https://github.com/TUTOUNITYFR/creer-un-jeu-en-2d-facilement-unity.git) in French.  

No particular story, or very advanced gameplay: simply the discovery of the tool and the basic concepts  
The goal is to be comfortable enough to create my own games and participate in a game jam in the future!
